Description: This package grew out of my research on temporal interpersonal emotion systems (TIES), hence the name "rties". It provides tools for using a suite of models to investigate temporal processes in bivariate (e.g., dyadic) systems. The general approach is to model, one dyad at a time, the dynamics of a variable that is assessed repeatedly from both partners, extract the parameter estimates for each dyad, use those parameter estimates as input to a latent profile analysis, and then use the predicted profile memberships for each dyad 
to either predict, or be predicted by, another variable of interest. Currently, 2 models are supported: 1) inertia-coordination, and 2) a coupled-oscillator. The models are currently restricted to distinguishable dyads.
