Description: This package grew out of my research on temporal interpersonal emotion systems (TIES), hence the name "rties". It provides tools for using a suite of models to investigate temporal processes in bivariate (e.g., dyadic) systems. The general approach is to model, one dyad at a time, the dynamics of a variable that is assessed repeatedly from both partners, extract the parameter estimates for each dyad, and then use those parameter estimates to either predict, or be predicted by, another variable of interest. Currently, 3 models are supported: 1) inertia-coordination, 2) patterned-slopes, and 3) a coupled-oscillator. The models are currently restricted to distinguishable dyads and, if using the dynamics to predict outcomes, those outcome variables must be normally distributed. Documentation is provided as pdfs in the "documentation" folder on the GitHub site.
